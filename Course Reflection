This course taught me the basics of sets, logic, graphs, and proofs, which helped me understand the foundation of computer science. 
At first I thought this course is like a normal mathematics i learnt at school but its different,as focuses on discrete rather than continuos.
Learning proofs, especially induction, was tough at first, but it really improved my logical thinking.
This course also taught me how important discrete structures are in computer science field, especially in data structures and algorithm.
